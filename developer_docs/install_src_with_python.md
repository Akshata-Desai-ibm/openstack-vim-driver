You will need:

- Python
- Pip

## Install

Clone this repository, navigate to the root directory and install with pip:

pip3 install --editable .
```

Note: `--editable` is added so live code changes in the osvimdriver package are reflected in the next startup without the need for a re-install through pip.

## Next Steps

Continue with the [official install instructions](../docs/install_with_python.md) to learn how to run the driver now it is installed (skip the pip install step)
