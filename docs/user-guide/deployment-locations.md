# Deployment Locations

A deployment location must be provided to an infrastructure request to indicate the Openstack environment to be used. The deployment location will be managed by the Stratoss&trade; Lifecycle Manager and Brent but must have particular properties to be successfully used by this driver.

# Properties

The following properties are supported by the driver:

| Name            | Default | Required                           | Detail                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| os_api_url      | -       | Y                                  | Defines the address of the Openstack environment. This address will be used for all API requests, including authentication |
| os_auth_enabled | True    | N                                  | Informs the driver that the Openstack environment requires authentication with keystone                                    |
| os_auth_api     | -       | Y - when `os_auth_enabled` is True | Defines the authentication API endpoint used to make authentication requests by this driver                                |
This driver currently supports password authentication only. The following properties may be set on a deployment location to configure the user for all requests:

| Name                        | Type    | Detail                          |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| os_auth_domain_id           | String  | ID for domain scoping           |
| os_auth_domain_name         | String  | Name for domain scoping         |
| os_auth_project_id          | String  | ID for project scoping          |
| os_auth_project_name        | String  | Name for project scoping        |
| os_auth_project_domain_id   | String  | Domain ID for named project     |
| os_auth_project_domain_name | String  | Domain name for named project   |
| os_auth_trust_id            | String  | ID for trust scoping            |
| os_auth_user_id             | String  | ID of user for authentication   |
| os_auth_username            | String  | Name of user for authentication |
| os_auth_user_domain_id      | String  | Domain ID for named user        |
| os_auth_user_domain_name    | String  | Domain name for named user      |
| os_auth_password            | String  | Password for user               |
| os_auth_unscoped            | Boolean | Use unscoped tokens             |

You will not need to provide values for all of the above properties, it depends on the type of scoping you require. You must use one of the following combinations:

- domain_id
- domain_name
- project_id
- project_name + project_domain_id
- project_name + project_domain_name
- trust_id
- unscoped

In addition, you must set the user and password with one of the following combinations:

- user_id + user_domain_id + password
- user_id + user_domain_name + password
- username + password

The following example shows a full set of valid properties for an Openstack deployment location:

```
"properties": {
    "os_auth_project_name": "my-project",
    "os_auth_project_domain_name": "default",
    "os_auth_password": "secret",
    "os_auth_username": "my-user",
    "os_auth_user_domain_name": "default",
    "os_auth_api": "identity/v3",
    "os_api_url": "http://10.10.8.8"
}
```
